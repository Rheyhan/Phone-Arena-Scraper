# Phone Arena Scraper

This repo is dedicated for scraping phone specifications from [Phone Arena](https://www.phonearena.com/). The main script `src.py` extracts detailed information about various phone models and saves it in a structured format.

I've created this project years ago as a personal endeavor to gather phone specs for analysis. But yeah, gonna release it publicly now because why not.

Scraped data as of 25 December 2025 is available as either `DATA/all.json` or `DATA/all.csv` in the root directory.

Please abide by Phone Arena's robots.txt[https://www.phonearena.com/robots.txt] and terms of service when using this scraper.
