# Phone Arena Scraper

This repo is dedicated for scraping phone specifications from [Phone Arena](https://www.phonearena.com/). The scraper extracts detailed information about various phone models, including their features and specifications.

The logic for scraping is implemented in the `coreLogicDebug.ipynb` file, which contains the main scraping functions and methods.

All the available phone specifications as in DEC 2025 can be found in the `DATA/` directory.
